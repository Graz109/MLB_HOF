This repo contains an Ipython notebook that contains a personal project I did attempting to predict
if a given pitcher will be inducted into the MLB Hall of Fame.

The scope of the project is currently focused on distinguishingbetween "good" players and "great" players. 
"Good" players are defined as those who are in consideration for Hall of Fame Induction and recieved at least 1 vote.  
A "Great"player is someone who has been inducted. I am attempting to understand what factors of a pitcher's career
contribute to the distinction.
